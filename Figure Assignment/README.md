Figure Assignment Summary

This project replicates Figure 1C from “Distinct µ-opioid ensembles trigger positive and negative fentanyl reinforcement” 
(Fabrice Chaudun, Laurena Python, Yu Liu, Agnes Hiver, Jennifer Cand, Brigitte L. Kieffer, Emmanuel Valjent & Christian Lüscher)

Strengths of Original Figure: 
- Overall message is clear: Naloxone was able to stop fentanyl-induced locomotion (seen with increased immobility time) but was interrupted with frequent jumps
- Could see a rough number of samples in each condition 
- Y axis is clear and intervals are evenly distributed
- Statistical differences are demonstrated clearly and look to be significant
Weakness of Original Figure:
- The dots representing the mouse subject are gathered and, making it a bit difficult to clearly see the box plot and number of samples used
    → replaced with filled in yet transparent dots, varying transparency helps to visualize overlapping data 
- The color of the Saline + Naloxone and Fentanyl and Saline blends with the dots to some extent
    → could be filled with a different brighter color but keep the dots dark

Interesting note on data replication:
Published figure had seem to have less points compared to the full data set published. Authors may have used some sort of filtering process to create the graphs. 
There were some varying points between the replication (using the full data of 81 observations) and published figure. This may have led to the R language to denote
"not significant" during the wilcoxon tests. 

Overall, the figure 1C reveals Naloxone influence on locomotion after fentanyl is induced in to the mouse.
